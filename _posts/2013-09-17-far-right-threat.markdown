DSA Vice Chair Joe Schwartz tells Rich Hilliard how the far right fixates on deficits and wants to close them only by cutting civilian discretionary spending. The center right and all too many Democrats are caught up in this too. It will take independent action by low-wage workers and immigrants to insist that jobs and infrastructure must come first, and then prosperity will reduce the deficit. It might help if progressives challenged centrist Democrats in primaries. Recorded August 18, 2013.
