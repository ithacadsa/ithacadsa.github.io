Jeff Cohen visited the occupied West Bank of Palestine and witnessed how Israeli settlers try use vandalism and violence to intimidate the Palestinian population in an attempt to drive them out. The government of Israel condones the crimes. But Palestinians and some Israelis are working together for human rights. The US media follows the line of the Israeli government, more one-sidedly than even the Israeli media. Recorded October 9, 2013.
