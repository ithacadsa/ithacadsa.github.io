Rich Hilliard quizzes Theresa Alt of DSA's National Political Committee about student debt and what people can do. It is a huge issue, though income-based repayment plans give some very limited relief. DSA has a petition drive to expand these programs to cover all student debt, but also to push for the bigger goal of free higher education. Recorded March 21, 2014.
