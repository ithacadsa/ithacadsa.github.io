Paul Bedard is both a theater director and a socialist activist. He tells Deirdre Silverman how he tries to bring out socialist ideas like class and inclusion in the plays he directs. He loves to introduce theater to activists and activism to theater people. One such play, The Infernal Machine, is about to be presented at the Hangar Theatre. Recorded June 29, 2015
