Bronwyn Bishop interviewed Theresa Alt after Democratic Socialists of America met in November 2015. For nearly two years they had been discussing their strategy, and when they met they had already come to consensus and unanimously ratified the document. The longterm goal is to put control of the means of production into democratic hands. But they don’t have to wait for state power. They can start to build the alternative now. Not that government is unimportant -- so in the short run they’re working for Bernie Sanders as well as against racism and doing a lot of education about the cooperatives and similar alternatives. Recorded December 15, 2015.
