Dominic Frongillo tells us more about the sustainable practices of the city of Freiburg, Germany. It all began with resistance to a proposed nuclear plant. The protesters then turned to politics, and the Green Party grew. But there is more that makes green practices possible. The utility company is owned by 90 municipalities and carries out their policies of sustainability. Federal money makes many projects possible. Young people don't go into debt over education or health expenses, so they can participate in public life. Recorded April 13, 2016.
