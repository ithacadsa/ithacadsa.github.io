Maria Svart, National Director of DSA, explains to Wayles Browne how under democratic socialism everybody would participate democratically in decisions about how we allocate our economic resources. This can be in the workplace through unions or cooperative ownership or at the national level. At present the 1% siphons off most of the wealth that the 99% create. DSA doesn't have a blueprint -- democratic decisions will determine the details. For sure, there will be space for entrepreneurship and creativity. Social democracy, the kind of program Sanders was talking about, is but a step in that direction. Recorded October 16, 2016.
