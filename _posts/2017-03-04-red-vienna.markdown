Vienna after World War I faced devastating shortages of everything, especially housing. The City elected a socialist government, which built massive housing projects that provided not just places to live but laundries, clinics, day care, education and sports facilities. The buildings were solid and beautiful and established an ongoing tradition of quality public housing. Theresa Alt and Kathy Russel recently visited Vienna. Recorded December 9, 2016.
