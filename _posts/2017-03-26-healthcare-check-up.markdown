Dan Lamb, who used to be an aide to Congrssman M. Hinchey, tells Deirdre Silverman about threats to the Affordable Care Act and how to counter them. Congressional Republicans want to use budget reconciliation to cut funding to the ACA, Medicaid and Medicare. Other aspects of the ACA that don't involve expenditures cannot be affected by reconciliation and are a separate fight. It might be better to seek single payer within New York State. Recorded February 10, 2017.
