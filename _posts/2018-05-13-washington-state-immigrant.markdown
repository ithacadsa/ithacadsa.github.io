Ramon Torres, President of a farmworkers’ union in Washington State, seeks higher wages, respect and better working conditions. The farmworkers want better chances for their kids. This takes a union contract. They do not want high-paid union officers negotiating for them. Now they can form farmworker cooperatives so that they don’t need bosses and can decide to go organic on their own berry farms. Recorded March 27, 2018 at a meeting organized by the Cornell Farmworker Program.
