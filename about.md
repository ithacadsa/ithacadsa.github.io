Ithaca DSA has a weekly cable access television program "Ithaca DSA Presents", a half-hour talk show covering local, national and international politics, economics and labor. It airs Tuesdays at 7:00 pm and Thursdays at 11:00 pm on [Time-Warner Cable Channel 13][cable-link] in Tompkins County; DVDs of the program can be borrowed from the [Alternatives Library][alternatives-link] in Anabel Taylor Hall on the Cornell Campus.

Ithaca DSA members also produce a half-hour radio program on [WRFI Community Radio][wrfi-link] called The Inquiring Socialist. The program airs at 6:30pm on alternate Tuesdays.

We will also be working on affordable housing and opposing police militarization and jail expansion in this community.
