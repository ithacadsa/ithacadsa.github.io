**All committees are led by members working together as volunteers. If you would like to get involved with these or start one of your own, [send us an email](mailto:ithacanydsa@gmail.com) and we'll connect you with the chair or coordinator.**

## Housing Committee

Our chapter’s housing committee has been active for years, working to promote housing justice in Ithaca. Our city has an unusually high cost of living that is getting worse, with luxury housing projects accelerating gentrification downtown and pushing more poor and working people out.

By speaking out in city meetings, organizing with the [Ithaca Tenants Union](https://www.ithacatu.org), and working to enact legislation that will protect tenants and adopt rent stabilization, we hope to work towards real affordable housing in Ithaca. Beyond that, our true goal is to see extensive, expansive public housing and tenant cooperatives in our city.

## Political Education Committee

First formed as the Jacobin Reading Group and later continuing as the Anti-Capitalist Reading Group, our education committee plans public events to discuss current issues in a way that broadens the horizons of what is possible. Topics are based on current events, and we encourage participation and input from all who attend.

We’ve recently addressed issues including socialist alternatives to policing, the tactics of anti-fascist organizing, the ideological differences between leftists and liberals, and socialist housing policy.

## Anti-Racist Coalition

In spite of a comfortable liberal reputation, Ithacans suffers from the same systemic racism as anywhere else. Our members meet regularly with the Tompkins County Anti-Racist/Depolicing Coalition, which brings together multiple local political groups to plan ways to reduce oppression, combat white supremacy, and reduce the effects of racialized policing.

We stand with community activists who have demanded significant cuts to the Ithaca Police Department budget, and we will continue to support systemic changes that will eliminate bias and injustice here in Ithaca. [Read and sign our letter drafted over the summer.](bit.ly/2DLWLtQ)

## Ecosocialist Working Group

Our future depends on immediately focusing significant resources towards building a sustainable world. Even with a revolutionary approach like the Green New Deal -- a program that grew out of socialist organizing -- the effects of climate change will continue to devastate the lives of poor and working people worldwide.

We have a role to play in pushing for a social and economic system that mitigates the effects of climate change, responds effectively and compassionately to the inevitable changes that it will bring to our social structures, and builds infrastructure towards a sustainable future.

## Labor Working Group

Democratic Socialism and a strong labor movement go hand in hand -- worker power depends on the people standing together, both in their workplaces and in the broader movement to promote real democratic society. Ithaca DSA has always stood with local workers as they organize, and we will continue to do so.

Our new labor working group will connect with local union organizers, provide a link between labor struggles and the wider community, and plan ways to give people the tools they need to take power in their lives.

## Electoral Working Group

Our problematic political system favors the wealthy and stonewalls real reforms by limiting democracy and the opportunity for regular people to participate. This makes it all the more important for us to find ways to elect working people to local office, people who will represent their communities and listen to the concerns of those who are left out of the system every day.

Because DSA is not a political party, we are open to working to support anyone who wants to run for office in order to make our society better, through real structural changes and an emphasis on participatory democracy.

## Communications Team

The communications team supports the effective operations of the chapter by managing our social media pages, email listservs, cable TV series, radio, and website as well as various other needs -- graphic design, photography, t-shirt and button making, and more. 

This work takes place mostly behind the scenes, but will help to craft our public presence and messaging. If you can provide time and expertise, get in touch!


## Other Opportunities

We’re currently looking for members to lead a working groups on Medicare for
All, to coordinate with YDSA on local campuses, to contribute to our social
media platforms, and more. If you have a passion or talent to contribute, we’ll
support it.
