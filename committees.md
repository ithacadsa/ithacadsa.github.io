**All committees are led by members working together as volunteers. If you would like to get involved with these or start one of your own, just reach out.**

## Affordable Housing Committee

We aim to help the community gain housing that is affordable to low-income and
to working people. Both rents and house prices are rising, and longtime
residents are being forced to move farther and farther from the city where they
work—a hardship for people and a disaster for the the environment. We speak at
meetings of government bodies and in small meetings with individual officials
to point out counterproductive tax abatements for luxury housing. 

Trickle-down does not work. Increasing the supply of affordable housing will
require some combination of public ownership, public financing and regulation.

Meetings are irregular, based on needs and local events. If you’d like to work
with us, email [ithacanydsa@gmail.com][main-email] or attend a monthly general
meeting.

## Electoral Committee

DSA is a big-tent socialist organization, not a political party. Our
electoral committee plans how best to support local and state politicians who
will work to implement socialist projects. **In 2020, we are organizing to support the Sanders campaign for president. If you would like to get involved, please send us an email.**

Ithaca DSA’s members have recently held training workshops on local election
rules and practices. We’re collaborating with potential candidates and building
towards a stronger, better and more inclusive left.

Meetings are irregular, based on our members’ availability. If you’d like to
work with us, email [ithacanydsa@gmail.com][main-email] or attend a monthly general meeting.

## TV & Radio

Ithaca DSA has a weekly tv program titled “Ithaca DSA Presents,” a 1/2 hour
talk show covering local, national and international politics, economics and
labor. DVDs can be borrowed from the Alternatives Library in Anabel Taylor Hall
on the Cornell campus, and some recent videos are online at
[ithacadsa.blogspot.com][old-site]. Ithaca DSA Presents airs Tuesdays at 7 p.m. and
Thursdays at 11 p.m. Time Warner Channel 13 in Tompkins County.

Our members also produce a half-hour program on WRFI Community Radio called The
Inquiring Socialist. The program airs at 6:30 p.m. on alternate Tuesdays. See
[wrfi.org](https://wrfi.org) to hear recent episodes. 

## Anti-Capitalist Reading Group (ARG)

The Anti-Capitalist reading group bring local leftists together to engage with ideas in a lively
and open environment. The groups are valuable intellectual spaces that cut
across organizational boundaries. 

Our own reading group has discussed topics including:

 * The ABCs of socialism
 * Questions of violence in revolutionary movements
 * The Paris Commune
 * The Rojava Revolution in Syria
 * The year 1968 and various radical and revolutionary movements of the time

Participants help select monthly readings and start the conversation by
presenting their own take on the literature. Find out when the next meeting is
by joining [the Google group][reading-group] at [jacobin-reading-group-ithaca@googlegroups.com][reading-email].

## Abolition Committee

Our mission is to dismantle oppressive state institutions and replace them with
community based alternatives and de-commodified universal public goods. 

* *Note: This committee is currently on hiatus. However, our members have been active with local campaigns to achieve justice for citizens unfairly targeted and brutalized by police.

## Other Opportunities

We’re currently looking for members to lead a working groups on Medicare for
All, to coordinate with YDSA on local campuses, to contribute to our social
media platforms, and more. If you have a passion or talent to contribute, we’ll
support it.
