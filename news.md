*Article by Barbara  & David Regenspan, DSA and Decarcerate Tompkins County Organizers*

"The coronavirus threatens us all, but those incarcerated in New York State’s prisons and immigrant detention centers are especially vulnerable.  Now more than ever, we need to question the legitimacy of incarceration as a means of promoting justice in our society. We need to re-educate ourselves."

Genevieve Rand tells Aurora Rojer about the campaign to get Ithaca Common Council to ensure that renters who have lost their jobs will not owe back rent when the eviction moratorium ends in June. The main tactic was a phone zap with over 100 people calling Council for 3 days. However, Council refused to vote for it. The Ithaca Tenants Union was instrumental and is renters' best hope for the future. Recorded April 22, 2020.

## [Black Politics, Class Struggle and the Illusion of Centrism](https://blackagendareport.com/black-politics-class-struggle-and-illusion-centrism)

*Article by Russell Rickford, DSA, Black Lives Matter, Tompkins County Workers Center, Multicultural Resource Center, and more*

"The central thrust of the 20th century black liberation struggle was a grassroots demand for social and economic redistribution that promised to empower all poor and laboring people. On some level, the African American masses have long recognized capitalism as a fundamental obstacle to their freedom...But how do we reconcile the tradition of principled African American resistance to capitalist oppression with the apparent support of older black voters for corporatist, neoliberal politicians like Joe Biden? If black America’s political sensibilities skew left, why does its voting majority hew to the center?"
